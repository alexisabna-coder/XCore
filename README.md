X-Core is a long-term, solo exploration project modeling and comparing modern operating systems (Linux, macOS, Android) while introducing XCoreOS—a conceptual system of the future. It’s a learning framework and portfolio-ready demonstration of professional system design, focused on clarity, architecture, and system-level thinking.
